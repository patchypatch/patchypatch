Hi, I'm Zak

Through personal projects, I am exploring my curiosities and improving my engineering skills in areas such as: embedded software development, mechanical design, 3D Printing, and PCB design. Typically, I work on these projects on my private gitlab account. I post portions of my projects here that I think could be interesting.
